**That's Phishy** is a website built with React, and runs by the backend of Flask that allows users to check if a URL is a Phishing Link or not. You can input any URL, and it will provide an output to determine whether it is a legitimate website or a Phishing website. Additionally, it offers a built-in browser extension that you can download and use in your browser to check links on the go.
